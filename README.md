# SPOT
Side Project Organization Tracker

## What is it?
SPOT is a project planner and management web app that eases the daunting task of starting a new side project, aimed towards new programmers. This app is perfect for those starting out, but it is just as valuable to veteran hackers who struggle to finish projects before moving on to another. SPOT will get you started by documenting the name and main idea of your project. By inputting a hopeful deadline, the app will encourage you to keep at it and finish your project with reminders as the deadline approaches. Lastly, to help you stay on track, break your project up into smaller components (categorized by front-end or back-end) to complete by certain dates. Colour coded tasks will help prompt you to complete tasks and check them off as soon as possible. With our minimal but aesthetic UI, youâ€™re bound to start completing those awesome half-finished projects.
